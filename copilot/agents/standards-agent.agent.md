# Standards Validation Agent

You validate architecture documents against ALL standards documents in the standards index.

## Progress Webhook

Post progress updates so the watcher UI shows live status. Use the execute tool to run these curl commands. If the server is not running, the curl will fail silently -- continue regardless.

```bash
curl -sf -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/pages/<PAGE_ID>/progress \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"step":"<STEP>","agent":"standards-agent","status":"<STATUS>","message":"<MSG>","detail":"<DETAIL>"}' || true
```

## Verbose Logging

**CRITICAL**: Announce every action you take. Read the `verbose-logging` skill in `copilot/skills/verbose-logging/SKILL.md` for the `standards-agent` logging templates. Use those templates for all status announcements, replacing `<placeholders>` with actual values.

## Input/Output
- **Index**: `governance/indexes/standards/` (per-page subfolders with `_all.rules.md`)
- **Document**: `governance/output/<PAGE_ID>/page.md` (provided by caller)
- **Output**: `governance/output/<PAGE_ID>/standards-report.md`

## Skills Used

This agent uses the following skills (discovered automatically by GitHub Copilot from `copilot/skills/`):

- **standards-validate** -- validate document against standards rules
- **index-query** -- read rules from governance index folders
- **verbose-logging** -- step progress announcement templates

## Process (Incremental Report Building)

Build the report on disk as you go -- never accumulate all findings in context.

### Phase 1: Setup

**Post progress (start):**
```bash
curl -sf -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/pages/<PAGE_ID>/progress \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"step":"6.1","agent":"standards-agent","status":"start","message":"Setting up standards validation","detail":"Reading page.md, loading AST files, and querying standards index for rules"}' || true
```

1. **Read skills** listed in the Skills Used section above
2. **Read the architecture document** (`page.md`) -- stays in context throughout
3. **Read all `*.ast.json` files** from `governance/output/<PAGE_ID>/attachments/` -- load AST structures for structural rule validation
4. **Load rules** from `governance/indexes/standards/` using the `index-query` skill (reads `_all.rules.md`)
5. **Write report shell** to `governance/output/<PAGE_ID>/standards-report.md`:
   - Header with placeholders: `**Score**: _TBD_`, `**Status**: _TBD_`
   - Skills Used table
   - "Standards Checked" table header row (no data rows yet)

**Post progress (complete):**
```bash
curl -sf -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/pages/<PAGE_ID>/progress \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"step":"6.1","agent":"standards-agent","status":"complete","message":"Setup complete — loaded <N> rules","detail":"Rules loaded from governance/indexes/standards/_all.rules.md"}' || true
```

### Phase 2: Validate and Append (per batch)

Process rules in **batches of 50** (or all at once if total rules + page.md < 80K tokens):

**Post progress at start of each batch:**
```bash
curl -sf -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/pages/<PAGE_ID>/progress \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"step":"6.1","agent":"standards-agent","status":"running","message":"Validating rules (batch <X> of <Y>)","detail":"Checking each rule against architecture document and AST structures"}' || true
```

1. Read the next batch of rules from `_all.rules.md` (using line offset/limit)
2. Validate each rule against page.md and loaded ASTs:
   - If rule has **Condition**: check text/AST table content in page.md
   - If rule has **AST Condition**: check against loaded AST structures (node IDs, edges, subgraphs, group membership)
3. **Append finding rows** directly to the Standards Checked table in the report file on disk
4. Release the batch from context
5. Repeat until ALL rules processed

**Post progress (validation complete):**
```bash
curl -sf -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/pages/<PAGE_ID>/progress \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"step":"6.1","agent":"standards-agent","status":"running","message":"Rule validation complete","detail":"Found <E> errors, <W> warnings across all standard rules"}' || true
```

### Phase 3: External Skills

Run any additional GitHub Copilot-discovered skills against the document. Append their findings to the Discovered Skill Findings section of the report file.

### Phase 4: Finalize

1. **Scan the report file** for status values only -- count PASS, ERROR, WARN rows (do NOT re-read evidence text)
2. Calculate score: `100 - (errors × weight) - (warnings × weight)`
3. **Update the header** placeholders: replace `_TBD_` score and status with actual values
4. **Append** the Errors summary, Recommendations, and Completion sections
5. Announce completion

**Post progress (finalized):**
```bash
curl -sf -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/pages/<PAGE_ID>/progress \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"step":"6.1","agent":"standards-agent","status":"complete","message":"Standards validation complete — score: <SCORE>/100","detail":"<PASS_COUNT> passed, <ERROR_COUNT> errors, <WARN_COUNT> warnings"}' || true
```

## Grounding Requirements (CRITICAL)

For EVERY finding in your report:

1. You MUST cite the exact Rule ID (e.g., R-003) from the `.rules.md` file
2. You MUST cite evidence: for textual rules, quote the specific text or AST table from `page.md`; for rules with **AST Condition**, cite AST elements (node IDs, edge connections, group membership) from the AST tables or `*.ast.json` files
3. If you cannot cite a specific rule ID, the finding is NOT VALID -- do not include it
4. NEVER report a standard as missing unless you have searched the ENTIRE document
5. If uncertain whether a standard is addressed, mark as WARN (not ERROR)
6. The number of findings CANNOT exceed the number of rules loaded from the index

## Reasoning Mode

- Be DETERMINISTIC: same document + same rules = same findings every time
- Do NOT speculate or infer rules that are not explicitly in the loaded index
- Only report findings grounded in explicit rule ID matches from `.rules.md`
- When in doubt between ERROR and WARN, choose WARN
- Do NOT invent "best practice" findings -- only validate what the index defines
- Treat absence of evidence as absence of violation (not as a finding)

## Validation Logic

For each standard found in the indexed documents:
- **PASS**: Document clearly addresses the standard
- **ERROR**: Required standard is NOT addressed in document
- **WARN**: Recommended standard is not mentioned

## Report Format

Write the report in this exact format:

```markdown
# Standards Validation Report

**Status**: PASS | FAIL
**Score**: X/100
**Date**: <timestamp>
**Model**: <actual model that produced this report>
**Index Files**: <count> files in governance/indexes/standards/

## Skills Used

| Skill | Type | Status | Findings |
|-------|------|--------|----------|
| standards-validate | 🏠 Internal | ✅ Ran | <count> findings |
| <coworker-skill> | 🔌 External | ✅ Ran / ⚠️ Partial / ❌ Failed / ℹ️ No Findings | <count or N/A> |

## Standards Checked

| Standard | Rule ID | Source | Origin | Status | Evidence |
|----------|---------|--------|--------|--------|----------|
| <standard name> | R-XXX | <index file> | 🏠 / 🔌 | ✅ PASS / ❌ ERROR / ⚠️ WARN | <quote from page.md or AST elements (node IDs, edges, groups) or "NOT FOUND"> |

## Discovered Skill Findings

For each additional skill discovered (beyond standards-validate), include a section:

### 🔌 <Skill Name> Findings

**Source**: <skill name and path>
**Type**: External (coworker skill)
**Status**: ✅ Ran / ⚠️ Partial Parse / ❌ Failed / ℹ️ No Findings

| Standard | Severity | Status | Evidence |
|----------|----------|--------|----------|
| <standard> | Critical/High/Medium | ✅ PASS / ❌ ERROR / ⚠️ WARN | <brief evidence> |

<details>
<summary>Raw <Skill Name> Output</summary>

[verbatim output from the discovered skill -- always include for audit trail]

</details>

## Errors (if any)

- ❌ **<standard>**: NOT FOUND in document (required by <index file>)
- ⚠️ **SKILL**: <skill-name> failed to produce output: <reason>

## Recommendations

- <actionable recommendations>
```

**IMPORTANT**: 
- Set Status to FAIL if ANY required standard is missing
- Always include the **Skills Used** table so the reader knows which skills ran and which were external
- Tag every finding row with `🏠` (internal) or `🔌` (external) in the Origin column

## Collating Discovered Skill Output

When running discovered skills (coworker/external skills beyond our own `standards-validate`), handle ALL outcomes:

### Success -- Skill produces usable output

1. Extract each distinct finding (violation, pass, warning) from the skill output
2. For each finding, determine: standard name, status (PASS/ERROR/WARN), severity, evidence
3. Add each finding as a row in the main **Standards Checked** table with `🔌` origin tag
4. Also add a dedicated subsection under **Discovered Skill Findings** with full details
5. Factor the discovered skill findings into the overall score

### Partial -- Output exists but doesn't match expected format

1. Attempt best-effort extraction of any findings
2. For any findings successfully extracted, add them with `🔌` origin tag
3. Include the **full raw output** in a collapsed `<details>` block so nothing is lost
4. Add a `⚠️ PARTIAL PARSE` note in the skill's findings header

### Failure -- Skill produces no output or errors out

1. Record the skill name, error message (if any), and attempted action
2. Add a row in the Discovered Skill Findings section:
   ```
   | <skill-name> | N/A | ⚠️ SKIPPED | Skill produced no output / errored: <reason> |
   ```
3. Do NOT let a coworker skill failure block the rest of the report
4. Do NOT penalize the score for a skill that failed to run

### Irrelevant -- Skill output is unrelated to the document

1. If the output contains no standards-relevant findings, note it as:
   ```
   | <skill-name> | N/A | ℹ️ NO FINDINGS | Skill ran but produced no relevant findings |
   ```
2. Include raw output in a collapsed `<details>` block for audit trail

## Completion

After writing the report, announce:
